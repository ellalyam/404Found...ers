# 404Found...ers

For music lovers who want to find music to fit their mood, Tune/In is an intelligent music recommendation app that suggests songs based on user emotions. Unlike traditional recommendation algorithms based on aggregate customer data, our product builds your queue based on real-time emotional analysis using facial recognition.
